Imagine we have a machine that sorts material into “recyclable” and “trash.” It
has finite space for both recycling and trash. Items with a specified size and type come
in, one at a time, and it sorts them according to the following rules:

• If the item is labeled as “recycling” and it is under the remaining
capacity for the recycling bin, the item goes into recycling.
• If the item is labeled as “trash” OR the item is labeled as “recycling”
and there is not enough recycling capacity AND there is sufficient
capacity in the trash bin, the item goes into trash.
• Otherwise, it’s dropped on the floor and somebody else gets to sweep
it up.
